# Design Decisions

Records of the implementation decisions behind the initial MVP, so future
changes can revisit them with context.

## D1: Web engine — wry (system webviews), not Servo

**Decision**: render web content through [wry](https://crates.io/crates/wry)
0.56, which wraps the platform webview: WebKitGTK on Linux, WKWebView on
macOS, WebView2 (Chromium) on Windows.

**Why not Servo?** Servo was evaluated first, per the project brief:

- Servo's embedding API (`libservo`) is still churning; it is not published
  as a stable crate on crates.io, and embedders are expected to track
  Servo's repository. Pinning VeloX to a moving embedding API contradicts
  the "actually runs, stays buildable" goal.
- Building Servo from source takes tens of minutes and a large toolchain
  (cmake, ninja, plus per-platform SDKs) — a heavy toll on every contributor
  and CI run.
- Web compatibility is still far behind WebKit/Chromium; the MVP goal is
  displaying real pages reliably.

**Why wry over alternatives?**

- Actively maintained (it underpins Tauri) with a documented, stable API.
- Small dependency surface for us: the engine ships with the OS, so VeloX
  binaries stay small and build times stay short.
- One codebase covers macOS / Linux / Windows today.

**Cost / revisit condition**: VeloX does not control the engine version and
the engine differs per OS. If VeloX later needs engine-level features
(custom networking, real content blocking, per-tab process control), that is
the moment to re-evaluate Servo embedding (or CEF) — the `ui`/`browser`
layering keeps that swap localized to `src/ui/window.rs`.

## D2: Window/event loop — tao, not winit

wry supports both. tao is maintained by the same project as wry, is gtk-based
on Linux (matching WebKitGTK, so no X11-only hacks — wry's winit example
explicitly panics on Wayland), and its event loop model is what Tauri
exercises in production against wry.

## D3: Browser chrome as an HTML toolbar in a second webview

Alternatives considered: native widgets per platform (three implementations),
a Rust GUI toolkit like egui/iced (a second rendering stack in the binary),
or drawing chrome inside the content webview (no isolation from untrusted
pages).

A dedicated toolbar webview reuses the engine we already ship, keeps chrome
isolated from page content, and needs zero additional dependencies. The
toolbar HTML is `include_str!`-ed into the binary, so there is nothing to
install alongside the executable.

## D4: Back/Forward via the engine's session history

`history.back()` / `history.forward()` are executed in the content webview
(wry exposes no dedicated go-back API, but the JS History API drives the same
WebKit/WebView2 session history). VeloX intentionally does not keep its own
history stack: the engine's history already handles redirects, `pushState`
and fragment navigation correctly, and a mirrored stack would drift. The
`Tab` struct mirrors only the current URL and loading flag for the UI.

Trade-off accepted for the MVP: without a queryable canGoBack/canGoForward,
the back/forward buttons are always enabled and act as no-ops at the history
edges.

## D5: Single-threaded state via event loop messages

Webview callbacks (IPC, navigation, page-load) run at unpredictable points.
Instead of sharing state behind mutexes, every callback posts a `UserEvent`
through tao's `EventLoopProxy`, and all state mutation happens in one match
statement on the main thread. Simpler to reason about, nothing to lock, and
one obvious place to add tracing/metrics later.

## D6: Dependency policy

Every direct dependency has one clear job:

| Crate | Job |
|---|---|
| `wry` | webview embedding (the engine) |
| `tao` | window + event loop |
| `serde` / `serde_json` | typed toolbar IPC messages; safe JS string escaping |
| `url` | parsing/normalizing address bar input |
| `gtk` (Linux only) | placing two webviews in one gtk window |

Notably absent on purpose: an async runtime (nothing here is async), an
error-handling framework (std `Result` + one `Box<dyn Error>` boundary at
startup suffices), and any HTTP client (the engine owns networking).

## D7: Address-bar input handling

Only `http(s)`, `file`, `about` and `data` URLs are accepted; schemeless
input is retried as `https://<input>`; anything else is rejected and the
address bar snaps back to the current page. No search-engine fallback yet —
that is a product decision (default engine, privacy) deferred until settings
exist. Rejecting unknown schemes also keeps surprises (e.g. `javascript:`)
out of the engine.

## D8: Content blocking — navigation-level only, wry 0.56 exposes no subresource hook

**Decision**: VeloX blocks ad/tracker domains at main-frame navigation time,
via `WebViewBuilder::with_navigation_handler` returning `false` for a
blocked URL (`src/ui/window.rs`). The matching itself is a small,
hand-written EasyList-subset parser/matcher (`src/browser/blocklist.rs`,
`FilterList`) — pure logic, no engine dependency, fully unit-tested.
Subresource-level blocking (images/scripts/XHR/fetch) is **not**
implemented; the reasons follow.

**What was checked**: wry 0.56.1's public API was read directly from the
vendored crate source
(`~/.cargo/registry/src/*/wry-0.56.1/src/lib.rs`, `webview2/mod.rs`,
`wkwebview/*`), specifically every `WebViewBuilder::with_*` method and the
CHANGELOG, looking for a request-interception hook usable for subresources.

**Findings, per platform**:

- **Cross-platform surface (what wry actually exposes today)**:
  `with_navigation_handler(Fn(String) -> bool)` — "decide if incoming url is
  allowed to navigate"; this is a frame-navigation decision (matches
  WebKitGTK's `decide-policy` for navigation actions / WKWebView's
  `decidePolicyForNavigationAction` / WebView2's `NavigationStarting`), not a
  per-subresource one. `with_custom_protocol` /
  `with_asynchronous_custom_protocol` intercept requests, but only for a
  custom URI *scheme* registered up front (e.g. `wry://`) — they are not
  invoked for ordinary `http`/`https` subresource loads, so they cannot be
  used as a generic ad-request filter. No `with_web_resource_request_handler`
  (or any request/response interception hook) exists in this version.
- **WebKitGTK (Linux)**: the issue's implementation notes point at WebKit's
  `WebKitUserContentFilter` (content-blocker JSON, compiled via
  `webkit_user_content_filter_store_save`). wry does not bind
  `WebKitUserContentFilter`, `WebKitUserContentManager`'s filter APIs, or the
  underlying `webkit2gtk` request-decision signals anywhere in its public
  surface or its `webkit2gtk`-backed internals that `wry::WebViewBuilder`
  exposes to callers.
- **WKWebView (macOS)**: same gap for `WKContentRuleList` /
  `WKContentRuleListStore` — not present in `wry::WebViewBuilderExtWebview2`
  or the `webkit2gtk`/`wkwebview` platform modules' public re-exports.
- **WebView2 (Windows)**: same gap for `ICoreWebView2.WebResourceRequested`
  (or `AddWebResourceRequestedFilter`) — wry's `webview2` module wires
  webview2-com's navigation and permission events, but not
  `WebResourceRequested`.

**Conclusion**: reaching any of the three platform-native subresource
hooks from `wry::WebViewBuilder` would require either (a) an upstream PR to
wry adding a cross-platform `with_web_resource_request_handler`-style API
(all three platforms have the underlying native hook; wry simply doesn't
bind it yet), or (b) reaching past `wry::WebView` into the raw platform
webview object it wraps (`webkit2gtk::WebView` / `WKWebView` /
`ICoreWebView2`) and driving the native filtering API directly per
platform — three separate, `unsafe`-adjacent implementations, which the
project's dependency/complexity budget (D6) and the "no unsafe" rule rule
out for this iteration. Per the issue's acceptance criteria, this
investigation result is recorded here instead of a subresource
implementation.

**Cost / revisit condition**: revisit once either upstream wry lands a
request-interception hook (watch the wry CHANGELOG), or VeloX outgrows wry
entirely (see D1's revisit condition, which already lists "real content
blocking" as a trigger for re-evaluating the engine layer).

**Filter list**: a small (~45-rule) hand-picked list of known ad/tracker
domains ships embedded in the binary (`src/browser/default_blocklist.txt`,
via `include_str!`), written in the same `||domain^` / `@@||domain^` syntax
EasyList/EasyPrivacy use so a real list can be dropped in later. It is
**not** a copy of EasyList/EasyPrivacy and nothing is fetched over the
network — this environment cannot verify network-list-update code, and it
would add scope (refresh scheduling, caching, format coverage) beyond a
single content-blocking PR. `Config::extra_blocklist_path` lets a user
point at a larger/updated list file, merged on top of the built-in one at
startup (`FilterList::merge`); fetching that file from a URL is left to a
follow-up issue.

**Why no `adblock`-style crate**: the matching needed here (domain-anchor
block/exception, nothing else) is a few dozen lines with no external
dependency; pulling in a full adblock-rule-engine crate for that would
violate D6's "every dependency has one clear job" bar, and would also add
network-fetching and cosmetic-filtering machinery VeloX does not use.
