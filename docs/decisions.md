# Design Decisions

Records of the implementation decisions behind the initial MVP, so future
changes can revisit them with context.

## D1: Web engine — wry (system webviews), not Servo

**Decision**: render web content through [wry](https://crates.io/crates/wry)
0.56, which wraps the platform webview: WebKitGTK on Linux, WKWebView on
macOS, WebView2 (Chromium) on Windows.

**Why not Servo?** Servo was evaluated first, per the project brief:

- Servo's embedding API (`libservo`) is still churning; it is not published
  as a stable crate on crates.io, and embedders are expected to track
  Servo's repository. Pinning VeloX to a moving embedding API contradicts
  the "actually runs, stays buildable" goal.
- Building Servo from source takes tens of minutes and a large toolchain
  (cmake, ninja, plus per-platform SDKs) — a heavy toll on every contributor
  and CI run.
- Web compatibility is still far behind WebKit/Chromium; the MVP goal is
  displaying real pages reliably.

**Why wry over alternatives?**

- Actively maintained (it underpins Tauri) with a documented, stable API.
- Small dependency surface for us: the engine ships with the OS, so VeloX
  binaries stay small and build times stay short.
- One codebase covers macOS / Linux / Windows today.

**Cost / revisit condition**: VeloX does not control the engine version and
the engine differs per OS. If VeloX later needs engine-level features
(custom networking, real content blocking, per-tab process control), that is
the moment to re-evaluate Servo embedding (or CEF) — the `ui`/`browser`
layering keeps that swap localized to `src/ui/window.rs`.

## D2: Window/event loop — tao, not winit

wry supports both. tao is maintained by the same project as wry, is gtk-based
on Linux (matching WebKitGTK, so no X11-only hacks — wry's winit example
explicitly panics on Wayland), and its event loop model is what Tauri
exercises in production against wry.

## D3: Browser chrome as an HTML toolbar in a second webview

Alternatives considered: native widgets per platform (three implementations),
a Rust GUI toolkit like egui/iced (a second rendering stack in the binary),
or drawing chrome inside the content webview (no isolation from untrusted
pages).

A dedicated toolbar webview reuses the engine we already ship, keeps chrome
isolated from page content, and needs zero additional dependencies. The
toolbar HTML is `include_str!`-ed into the binary, so there is nothing to
install alongside the executable.

## D4: Back/Forward via the engine's session history

`history.back()` / `history.forward()` are executed in the content webview
(wry exposes no dedicated go-back API, but the JS History API drives the same
WebKit/WebView2 session history). VeloX intentionally does not keep its own
history stack: the engine's history already handles redirects, `pushState`
and fragment navigation correctly, and a mirrored stack would drift. The
`Tab` struct mirrors only the current URL and loading flag for the UI.

Trade-off accepted for the MVP: without a queryable canGoBack/canGoForward,
the back/forward buttons are always enabled and act as no-ops at the history
edges.

## D5: Single-threaded state via event loop messages

Webview callbacks (IPC, navigation, page-load) run at unpredictable points.
Instead of sharing state behind mutexes, every callback posts a `UserEvent`
through tao's `EventLoopProxy`, and all state mutation happens in one match
statement on the main thread. Simpler to reason about, nothing to lock, and
one obvious place to add tracing/metrics later.

## D6: Dependency policy

Every direct dependency has one clear job:

| Crate | Job |
|---|---|
| `wry` | webview embedding (the engine) |
| `tao` | window + event loop |
| `serde` / `serde_json` | typed toolbar IPC messages; safe JS string escaping |
| `url` | parsing/normalizing address bar input |
| `gtk` (Linux only) | placing two webviews in one gtk window |

Notably absent on purpose: an async runtime (nothing here is async), an
error-handling framework (std `Result` + one `Box<dyn Error>` boundary at
startup suffices), and any HTTP client (the engine owns networking).

## D7: Address-bar input handling

Only `http(s)`, `file`, `about` and `data` URLs are accepted; schemeless
input is retried as `https://<input>`; anything else is rejected and the
address bar snaps back to the current page. No search-engine fallback yet —
that is a product decision (default engine, privacy) deferred until settings
exist. Rejecting unknown schemes also keeps surprises (e.g. `javascript:`)
out of the engine.

## D8: History/bookmarks persistence — JSON files, no new dependency

History (`browser::history::HistoryStore`) and bookmarks
(`browser::bookmarks::BookmarkStore`) are plain, serde-derived structs;
`browser::persistence` is a thin wrapper that reads/writes each as its own
pretty-printed JSON file (`history.json`, `bookmarks.json`) using `serde`/
`serde_json`, both already dependencies (D6). No database crate was added —
the issue's own guidance is to start file-based and revisit (SQLite or
similar) only once entry counts make that necessary; `HistoryStore` already
enforces a cap (`Config::history_max_entries`, default 5000), so an
unbounded file is not a near-term risk.

The collection logic (de-duplication of consecutive visits/bookmarked URLs,
the history cap, ordering, removal) lives entirely in `history.rs`/
`bookmarks.rs` as pure functions with no filesystem or UI dependency, per the
existing `browser::navigation`/`browser::tab` pattern — that is what the unit
tests exercise. `persistence.rs` only turns a store into/from JSON on disk
and is intentionally "dumb"; its own tests are the round-trip-through-a-temp-
directory kind, not collection-logic tests.

**Data directory resolution**: a `dirs`-style crate was considered and
rejected for the same reason new dependencies generally are (D6) — the need
is met by reading the one environment variable each platform already
guarantees (`XDG_DATA_HOME`/`HOME` on Linux/BSD, `HOME` on macOS, `APPDATA`
on Windows), with `VELOX_DATA_DIR` as an explicit override used by nothing
in-repo today but available for tests or portable installs. If VeloX later
needs more XDG-adjacent behavior (config dir, cache dir, respecting
`XDG_DATA_DIRS` for lookup, etc.) that breadth is the point at which pulling
in `dirs` starts paying for itself; one directory for one file pair does not
justify it yet. When no relevant environment variable is set, VeloX degrades
to an unpersisted in-memory session (logged once at startup) rather than
failing to start.

## D9: History/bookmarks UI is a panel in the toolbar webview, not a content-webview page

The toolbar and content areas are two separate native webviews with
independently managed bounds (D3); a dropdown rendered inside the toolbar
webview's HTML cannot visually extend over the content webview's screen
region, since each webview is clipped to its own allocated rect. Two designs
were considered:

- **A dedicated internal page** (e.g. `velox://history`) loaded into the
  *content* webview, in the spirit of `chrome://`/`about:` pages in other
  browsers. Rejected for now: making it interactive (delete/clear buttons)
  would need either an IPC channel on the content webview — which breaks the
  D3 security boundary that untrusted page content can never talk to
  Rust — or intercepting `velox://`-scheme navigations in the existing
  content `navigation_handler`, which is reachable by *any* loaded page
  (`<a href="velox://history?clear=1">`), not just our own generated one,
  without extra provenance tracking real browsers use to gate `chrome://`
  navigation to trusted origins only. Solvable, but more machinery than this
  issue needs.
- **A panel inside the toolbar webview, grown into view** (chosen): opening
  the history/bookmarks panel resizes the toolbar webview's own native
  bounds (`toolbar_height` + `Config::panel_height`, see
  `ui::window::effective_toolbar_height`) instead of overlaying anything;
  the panel's HTML/CSS just fills whatever height the webview actually has
  (`body { display:flex; flex-direction:column }`, `#panel { flex:1 }`).
  This keeps the panel inside the already-trusted webview — no new IPC
  surface, no scheme interception — at the cost of the content webview
  visibly shrinking while a panel is open (acceptable: it is a deliberate,
  user-triggered, temporary state, closed automatically on navigating from a
  panel entry).

`BrowserWindow` tracks which panel is open in a `Cell<Option<Panel>>`
(interior mutability, main-thread-only) because the window-resize handler in
`app.rs` only holds `&BrowserWindow`, not the mutable app state, and still
needs to preserve the open panel's extra height across a resize.

## D10: Page titles are fetched asynchronously and applied best-effort

wry's `WebView::evaluate_script` cannot return a value synchronously; only
`evaluate_script_with_callback` can, and its callback fires later (and off
the call stack that triggered it). So `LoadFinished` records a history entry
with `title: None` immediately (using the URL as the interim display value),
then asks `document.title` for that entry's `id` and applies whatever comes
back whenever it arrives (`UserEvent::PageTitleResolved`). This matches the
staged design the issue itself suggested as acceptable. A blank/whitespace
title is dropped rather than overwriting a previously known one (covers
pages that briefly have an empty `<title>` before script sets it); the
result always applies to the `id` it was requested for regardless of what
the tab is showing by the time it arrives, so a late title only ever affects
the (now possibly no-longer-current) history entry it belongs to.

## D11: Single choke point for disabling history recording

`app::record_visit_if_enabled` is the only place `HistoryStore::record_visit`
is called from, gated by `AppState::history_enabled` (`true` today — nothing
in this issue's scope ever sets it to `false`). This is the seam the
following issue, #7 (private browsing), is expected to use: making
`history_enabled` reflect whether the active tab/window is private needs no
change to `HistoryStore` itself, `persistence`, or any other call site.
Bookmarking is deliberately **not** gated by this flag — explicitly saving a
bookmark is a distinct user action from passive visit recording, and real
browsers typically keep letting users bookmark from a private
window/tab — but the same `AppState`-level pattern would extend to it if a
future decision says otherwise.
