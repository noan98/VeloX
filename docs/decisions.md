# Design Decisions

Records of the implementation decisions behind the initial MVP, so future
changes can revisit them with context.

## D1: Web engine — wry (system webviews), not Servo

**Decision**: render web content through [wry](https://crates.io/crates/wry)
0.56, which wraps the platform webview: WebKitGTK on Linux, WKWebView on
macOS, WebView2 (Chromium) on Windows.

**Why not Servo?** Servo was evaluated first, per the project brief:

- Servo's embedding API (`libservo`) is still churning; it is not published
  as a stable crate on crates.io, and embedders are expected to track
  Servo's repository. Pinning VeloX to a moving embedding API contradicts
  the "actually runs, stays buildable" goal.
- Building Servo from source takes tens of minutes and a large toolchain
  (cmake, ninja, plus per-platform SDKs) — a heavy toll on every contributor
  and CI run.
- Web compatibility is still far behind WebKit/Chromium; the MVP goal is
  displaying real pages reliably.

**Why wry over alternatives?**

- Actively maintained (it underpins Tauri) with a documented, stable API.
- Small dependency surface for us: the engine ships with the OS, so VeloX
  binaries stay small and build times stay short.
- One codebase covers macOS / Linux / Windows today.

**Cost / revisit condition**: VeloX does not control the engine version and
the engine differs per OS. If VeloX later needs engine-level features
(custom networking, real content blocking, per-tab process control), that is
the moment to re-evaluate Servo embedding (or CEF) — the `ui`/`browser`
layering keeps that swap localized to `src/ui/window.rs`.

## D2: Window/event loop — tao, not winit

wry supports both. tao is maintained by the same project as wry, is gtk-based
on Linux (matching WebKitGTK, so no X11-only hacks — wry's winit example
explicitly panics on Wayland), and its event loop model is what Tauri
exercises in production against wry.

## D3: Browser chrome as an HTML toolbar in a second webview

Alternatives considered: native widgets per platform (three implementations),
a Rust GUI toolkit like egui/iced (a second rendering stack in the binary),
or drawing chrome inside the content webview (no isolation from untrusted
pages).

A dedicated toolbar webview reuses the engine we already ship, keeps chrome
isolated from page content, and needs zero additional dependencies. The
toolbar HTML is `include_str!`-ed into the binary, so there is nothing to
install alongside the executable.

## D4: Back/Forward via the engine's session history

`history.back()` / `history.forward()` are executed in the content webview
(wry exposes no dedicated go-back API, but the JS History API drives the same
WebKit/WebView2 session history). VeloX intentionally does not keep its own
history stack: the engine's history already handles redirects, `pushState`
and fragment navigation correctly, and a mirrored stack would drift. The
`Tab` struct mirrors only the current URL and loading flag for the UI.

Trade-off accepted for the MVP: without a queryable canGoBack/canGoForward,
the back/forward buttons are always enabled and act as no-ops at the history
edges.

## D5: Single-threaded state via event loop messages

Webview callbacks (IPC, navigation, page-load) run at unpredictable points.
Instead of sharing state behind mutexes, every callback posts a `UserEvent`
through tao's `EventLoopProxy`, and all state mutation happens in one match
statement on the main thread. Simpler to reason about, nothing to lock, and
one obvious place to add tracing/metrics later.

## D6: Dependency policy

Every direct dependency has one clear job:

| Crate | Job |
|---|---|
| `wry` | webview embedding (the engine) |
| `tao` | window + event loop |
| `serde` / `serde_json` | typed toolbar IPC messages; safe JS string escaping |
| `url` | parsing/normalizing address bar input |
| `gtk` (Linux only) | placing two webviews in one gtk window |

Notably absent on purpose: an async runtime (nothing here is async), an
error-handling framework (std `Result` + one `Box<dyn Error>` boundary at
startup suffices), and any HTTP client (the engine owns networking).

## D7: Address-bar input handling

Only `http(s)`, `file`, `about` and `data` URLs are accepted; schemeless
input is retried as `https://<input>`; anything else is rejected and the
address bar snaps back to the current page. No search-engine fallback yet —
that is a product decision (default engine, privacy) deferred until settings
exist. Rejecting unknown schemes also keeps surprises (e.g. `javascript:`)
out of the engine.

## D8: Performance metrics — `/proc` directly, no new dependency

**Decision**: implement startup timestamps, page-load duration and
process-tree RSS sampling (Issue #3) as a pure, UI/engine-independent module
(`browser::metrics`), reading `/proc` directly on Linux instead of adding a
crate like `sysinfo`.

**Why not `sysinfo` (or similar)?** `sysinfo` (and comparable crates) pull in
a much larger surface than this needs — full per-process CPU/disk/network
stats, a whole-system snapshot API, and platform backends for OSes VeloX does
not even build native RSS support for yet. VeloX's own dependency policy
(D6) asks "why is this needed" before adding a crate; here the actual need
is two integers per process (`PPid`, `VmRSS`) out of a text file the kernel
already exposes, which is a few dozen lines of parsing — well within "not
worth a dependency" territory. Per D6's own logic (the engine already ships
what we need, don't duplicate it in a crate), the direct-`/proc` route is
also what let this land with zero new lines in `Cargo.toml`.

**Design**:

- `browser::metrics` holds only pure logic: `StartupTimestamps` (four
  checkpoints → a `Duration` report), `PageLoadTimer` (start/finish →
  `Duration`), and `sample_process_tree_rss(pid)` (walks `/proc`, sums
  `VmRSS` over the whole descendant tree — WebKit's network/render/GPU
  helper processes included, since a single-PID reading would understate
  real memory use). All formatting and tree-walking is unit-tested with
  synthetic data; the `/proc` integration itself is exercised against the
  test process's own tree (including a spawned child) since CI runs on
  Linux.
- `sample_process_tree_rss` is a standalone function — no `Config` or app
  state involved — specifically so Issue #5 (tab suspension) can call it
  directly to measure RSS before/after suspending a tab, independent of
  whether startup/page-load logging is enabled.
- Enabling is a `Config` flag (`perf_metrics`, plus `perf_rss_interval` for
  the periodic RSS sampler), following the existing `VELOX_DEBUG` env-var
  pattern via `Config::from_env` (`VELOX_PERF_METRICS`,
  `VELOX_PERF_RSS_INTERVAL_MS`). When off, `app::run` never calls
  `Instant::now()` for these checkpoints and never spawns the sampling
  thread — the check is a single `Option::is_none()`/`bool` per event, so
  the disabled path carries no meaningful overhead.
- Output is structured `eprintln!` lines (`velox[perf] …`) for now, matching
  the issue's "stderr is enough for now" scope; visualization/CI benchmarks
  are left to follow-up issues.

**Cost / revisit condition**: the `/proc` path only covers Linux precisely.
Non-Linux Unix falls back to shelling out to `ps` (untested by this
project's Linux-only CI); Windows returns `RssError::Unsupported` for now.
If accurate cross-platform RSS becomes a priority before this project adds a
Windows/macOS CI leg, that is the point to revisit a crate (or
platform-specific APIs) with the actual OSes to test against, rather than
guessing at `ps`/API behavior blind.
